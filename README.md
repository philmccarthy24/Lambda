# Lambda v0.9
## Difference coding compression library for C++

### Overview
This library provides C++ programs the ability to space efficiently encode the differences between two
files (or buffers). The compressed form (the "lambda" data) can then be used to patch the standalone
original file (or buffer) to the updated version.

### Getting started
In development

### Compatibility

Released as a VS 2012 solution, but the code should port trivially to any compiler.
